This is a framework for classifying datastreams.

It includes a few interfaces, a function to run an experiment with
specified modules, and a few implementations of different modules.

## Interfaces
### StreamingData
An object that can provide a stream of observations and corresponding
labels at arbitrary points in time.

__Properties__:
- `tMax`: the maximum time (ending time) of the experiment
- `y`: A column vector specifying the possible class labels
- `d`: A scalar specifying the number of dimensions in the dataset

__Methods__:
- `[x, y] = obj.sample(t, y)`: Sample a new observation at time `t`
from class `y`. `y` should be optional and drawn from a uniform
distribution containing all possible classes by default. `t` is
required.

### StreamPlotter
This object is used to plot datasets that come from a stream. Objects
that implement this interface should hide older observations as the
data changes.

__Properties__:
- `axh`: The handle to the axes the plotter is using
- `n`: The number of most recent points to retain on the graph
- `colors`: A * by 3 matrix specifying the RGB values of the plotter's
colormap. This can be any length, and the plotter should restart
from the beginning of the matrix if there are more classes than colors

__Methods__:
- `obj.plot(X, c)` plot observation `X` as color specified by index `c`

### ClassifierModel
The actual classifier for data streams

__Methods__:
- `obj.train(X, y, t)`: Train the classifier with observations specified
in `X` that were drawn at time `t` from class `y`. The number of rows in
`X`, `y`, and `t` must match. `y` can be a vector or matrix containing
posterior probabilities. If `y` is a matrix, the sum of its columns must
be a vector of `1`s.

- `h = obj.classify(X, t)`: Predict the labels of the observations in `X`
drawn at time `t`. The number of rows in `X` and `t` must be the same. `h`
is a vector containing the same number of rows as `X` and `t`, with integers
specifying the class label that the observations belong to, according to the
classifier.

## Implementations

### ForgettingKnnClassifier
__Constructor__: `obj = ForgettingKnnClassifier(opts)`
`opts` is a `struct` with the following fields:
=======================
| Field | Description |
=======================
| rowPadding | The number of rows to grow the resizable array X when it gets full (_default_: 500) |
| k          | The number of nearest neighbors to consider (_default_: 25) |
| beta       | The forgetting rate over time (_default_: .1) |
==========================
